## Task A1.1: Dockerize NodeJS application

1.  Run the NodeJS application locally to ensure that it is working properly, and note down the port number that the application is listening to as the port would need to be exposed in `dockerfile`.
2.  Create `dockerfile` in the same directory as the NodeJS application, in this case that would be `.../a1/app` with the following configuration shown below.

### `dockerfile` configuration

```docker
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY package.json .
RUN yarn install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

#### Explanation of `dockerfile`

* `alpine` was chosen for its smaller size
* `WORKDIR` determines the working directory inside the docker container by implicitly doing `mkdir` recursively and `cd` into it.
* Copying the `package.json` is necessary as it has the list of dependencies that the NodeJS app requires, and it copies it into the `WORKDIR`.
  * Note: `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` was not copied over since it only speeds up the installation process. For experimenting purposes this was left out, similar to why `yarn` was used instead of `npm`.
* `yarn install` is then executed so that the necessary node modules are downloaded and installed into the `node_module` directory which was not copied over.
* The other contents of the local directory (mainly the Node application itself) is then copied into `WORKDIR`.
* Port `3000` is then exposed as that is the port that Express is configured to listen on.
  * Multiple ports (and protocols) can be specified if needed
  * Example: `EXPOSE 22 69/udp 443/tcp 3000`
* The application can then be started by executing the `CMD` command.
  * `RUN` is done on the build step and commits the result that is used for the next steps in `dockerfile`.
  * `CMD` provide defaults for an executing container.
    * If multiple `CMD` is used, only the last one would take effect

### Building and Running the Docker Container

#### Building

After the `dockerfile` has been configured properly, a Docker container would need to be created. This can be done by issuing the following command.

```bash
# docker build <app-dir> -t <lowercased-hyphenated-name>
docker build . -t my-cool-nodejs-app
```

#### Running

The container would then be created and can start by running. In the example, port 8080 is bound to 3000 locally, which means that accessing `localhost:8080` would be directed to `localhost:3000` which the Express server is listening to and is able to serve the right HTML file.

```bash
# docker run -p [<IP-address>:]<client port>:<source port> -d <lowercased-hyphenated-name>
# Not specifying the IP addressess opens the service to external access.
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:3000 -d my-cool-nodejs-app

# OPTIONALLY: pipe with pbcopy to copy the container ID
# docker run -p 8080:3000 -d my-cool-nodejs-app | pbcopy

# Ensure that the docker instance is up and running by checking its status. 
# Port binding information can also be viewed from here.
docker ps -a 
```

## Task A1.2: Dockerize NGINX reverse proxy

### Serving static HTML file

To get a simple NGINX service running, simply use the NGINX docker image and copy `index.html` over to where NGINX is configured to serve static files which can be seen in its default configuration (`/etc/nginx/conf.d`). This can be configured to any directory but for simplicity, the default path is used. Below shows a snippet of the default `conf.d`.

```bash
    # other config
    listen     80;
    # ...
    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    # other config
```

---

Based on that snippet, a `dockerfile` can now be created by copying over the modified `index.html`.  Based on the default configuration, NGINX listens to port 80.

The `alpine` release is used as it is smaller (25MB `nginx:alpine`; 140MB `nginx:latest`).

```docker
FROM nginx:alpine

COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

The docker container can now be built and ran by using the following commands

```bash
# Build the docker container
docker build . -t nginx-sample-alpine

# Run the container
docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx-sample-alpine

# Ensure that it is running
docker ps -a

# Access the modified index.html via browser or CURL
curl localhost
```

### Setting up NGINX Reverse Proxy

Building off from [the section above](#task-a11-dockerize-nodejs-application), the `default.conf` would now be overwritten as such:

```bash
server {
    listen      80;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9001;
    }
}

server {
    listen      9001;
    root        /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index       index.html;
}
```

#### Explanation of NGINX configuration

In the previous section, NGINX listens to port 80 and serves the appropriate `index.html` file. Here, instead of serving the file directly, it would proxy to `localhost:9001` which would then serve the static file. This can also be configured to be a separate machine and a similar configuration can be used to load-balance but those are beyond the scope of this demonstration.

The building, running, and testing steps are the same as the section above. Note that port 9001 does not have to be open as the proxy would automatically redirect traffic entering on 80 to 9001.

```bash
docker build . -t nginx-sample-alpine
docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx-sample-alpine 
# docker ps -a

 curl localhost:9001 # Connecion refused
 curl localhost # Prints contents of index.html
```

Running it on the browser also get the same results.

## Task A1.3: NGINX serve NodeJS application

Having done [Task A1.1](#task-a11-dockerize-nodejs-application) and [Task A1.2](#task-a12-dockerize-nginx-reverse-proxy), a reverse proxy that can serve the NodeJS application can now be built.

This can be done by using `docker-compose`, but before doing so a `dockerimage` of NGINX should be built with the appropriate configuration which is as follows.

```bash
# default.conf -- proxy to the nodejs application
# keep the hostname of the proxy server in mind.
server {
    listen      80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://nodejs:3000;
    }
}
```

```docker
# NGINX dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d
```

The following `docker-compose.yml` should be created in the root directory of `app` which contains the NodeJS application and `nginx` which contains the configuration to proxy to the NodeJS application.

```docker
version: "3.8"
services:
  # This is the hostname to proxy to
  nodejs:
    build:
      context: ./app
  nginx:
    build: 
      context: ./nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

Notice that in the configuration, only port 80 is bound to NGINX's port 80. NodeJS' port 3000 does not need to be exposed as it is proxied to via NGINX.

To serve the application, the following can be ran.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To test, in a new terminal run the following.

```bash
curl localhost:3000 # Connection refused, port not exposed
curl localhost # NodeJS application is served
```

Testing on the browser would also yield the same result, but with the NodeJS application being rendered properly as shown below.
